# Laptop Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of laptops using machine learning models. The dataset includes various features that influence laptop prices, such as brand, screen resolution, CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and operating system.

### Project Structure

- **Data:** The dataset (`laptop_price.csv`) contains laptop specifications and their corresponding prices in euros.
- **Notebooks:** The Jupyter notebook details the steps involved in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- **Models:** Various regression models were implemented to predict laptop prices.

### Features

The key features used in the prediction models include:

- **Brand:** Manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Apple, Dell, HP).
- **Screen Resolution:** Resolution of the laptop screen.
- **CPU:** Processor type and speed.
- **RAM:** Amount of RAM in GB.
- **Storage:** Type and size of storage (SSD, HDD, etc.).
- **GPU:** Graphics processing unit.
- **Operating System:** The operating system installed (e.g., Windows, macOS).
- **Weight:** The weight of the laptop.
- **Price:** The price in euros (target variable).

### Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adeel-Farooq-Khan/Laptop-Price-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data and models.

### Usage

- Load the dataset and perform data preprocessing.
- Implement feature engineering to extract and refine features.
- Build and train regression models to predict laptop prices.


### Results

The models successfully predicted laptop prices with high accuracy, making it easier to estimate the price based on specifications.
